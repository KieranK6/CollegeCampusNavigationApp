try rooms like.. eg
P001
P002
P122
P120 - there is multipe of these, should make an extra menu to chose which you want to got for, you will see that multiples are stored in a seporate indexing space so this should be handy to finish up
N001
N008
BS001
GH0023

TO NOTE
*this is case sensitive at the mo*
*base function only, no nice fancy stuff but good storage structure*
*multiple of the same room name would be rare enough to happen in DKIT cause room number include a prefix letter or two to denote the building, however multiples of the same room have been planeed for, there is some sudo code in place to show you where an extra menu should be triggered to pop up for the user to see which buildings conatin the room they have asked for, so they can choose one and then have that building shown*
